This project is aimed at training YOLOv3 on the VOC dataset. As for the code, we mainly use the code given by ultralytics and modify some parts of it. Fo  example, we add the function to calculate mIoU(mean interaction over union) and accuracy, which are of vital importance in the object detecting field. In the following parts, I will show you a quick start(or a recommended way to train) and specific details concerning training and testing process.
